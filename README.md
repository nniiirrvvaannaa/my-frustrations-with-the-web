# My frustrations with computers and the web!!!!!!
## this is a dump of my thoughts and feelings during the project and what feelings i have about the web in general

1. WTF is a read me file and how do you make one 
2. why do i have to use these stupid signs 
3. im writing a list right now. i dont even have to write a list im doing one to show that i can use these stupid signs

**hehe look im using bold text**

^i had to adjust that 3 different times for it to go bold why why why why

> wtf even is a block quote but apparently if i put this sign infront itll turn into one. why is all this technological stuff so difficult to use i really feel like a victim to the web. this isnt an environment i feel comfortable. i feel week and helpless, i feel like i cant understand something i should be able to understand. i think the people next to me are doing creative computing, they seem to get it. HOW DO THEY GET IT??

okay i just checked the preview and the block quote looks pretty cool

---is this going to cross out?

^it didnt. then what does it really do?
---

did i find something new?? using ^ makes things big ????

^this is me trying it again to make sure
### well that didnt work. how comes it became big? why did it become big??- yes i intentionally made this one big. its H3 size apparently

im looking for the squigly thing on my keyboard so i can do a strike through. WHERES THE SQUIGLY THING?

ahh found it ~

~~hellooooooo~~.  well that didnt work. why didnt it work??

aomething else about this programme or whatever it is (a website?) it doesnt auto correct and im dyslexic so ive been going through and correcting every spelling mistake ive decided to stop that now and i unintentionally made a mistake ar the beginning ah look i did it agoan oh and again. look at me go. 
> its hard to be lazy when it comes to actual computer stuff usually im lazy on the internet: auto correct, suggested shit you get and all of that i use on a daily basis.

| Syntax ( idk what a syntax is) | me trying to make a table |

| 1 | 0 | 

thats a scoreboard to show how i feel 
### DEFEATED
i have no idea how im gonna save this when im done and you know what knowing my luck with technology ill probably find a way to lose this file. before i go i want to try and upload a picture 
!!

look at me go !! i can use the programme now HAHA SUCK IT TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTING I DID IT I UPLOADED A PICTURE IT WAS SO EASY JAHAHAHAHAHAAH

>ill be honest. i had no isdea what i was going to do and all my classmates were stuck and none of us understood the brief or wtf we were supposed to do. it led me to tears. i actually had anger tears iver this. then it led to a nose bleed and i now have a headache. all of this over a little project on computers and shit. but now through this document or whatever it is ive learnt to use git hub and my anger and frustration has turned into smugness. i can do it now. im done.
